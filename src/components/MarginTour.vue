          This is the data explorer of the <b>Ecohealth Tracking Tool</b> (ETT). MassBays manages the Massachusetts Estuaries from Newburyport to Provincetown. The MassBays region is subdivided into 46 embayment watersheds. Within these embayment watersheds, you can use the explorer to learn about <i>habitats</i> (types, extent, and historical trends) and <i>water quality</i> (monitoring locations and historical trends).

          You can use the scroll button to zoom in or out on the map. You can also click on any embayment to zoom directly to that embayment. You can always return to this tour by clicking the "Take a Tour" button.

        <p>
          In order to explore habitats, toggle the habitat layer on and select one habitat type from the available options. The extent of the habitat will be shown on the map and a graph will show on the right side of the page indicating the historical trends for the habitat.
          <br>
          In addition to the graph, you can toggle on the habitat target layer to see how each watershed embayment is performing relative to the targets set by MassBays. If you start exploring the water quality data and wish to go back to the habitat graph, use the tabs at top of the graph to switch between habitat data and water quality data.

          In order to explore water quality, toggle the water quality layer on and select one of the water quality parameters. The stations that have data for that parameter will light up blue. You can then click on the station to see a graph of the measurements for that parameter at that station. If you start exploring the habitat data and wish to go back to the water quality graph, use the tabs at top of the graph to switch between habitat data and water quality data.
